            Lyrics of <h5>Everything At Once</h5>
            <article>
                As Warm As The Sun<br>
                As Silly As Fun<br>
                As Cool As A Tree<br>
                As Scary As The Sea<br>
                <br>
                As Hot As Fire<br>
                Cold As Ice<br>
                Sweet As Sugar<br>
                And Everything Nice<br>
                <br>
                As Old As Time<br>
                As Straight As A Line<br>
                As Royal As A Queen<br>
                As Buzzed As A Bee<br>
                <br>
                As Stealth As A Tiger<br>
                Smooth As A Glider<br>
                Pure As A Melody<br>
                Pure As I Wanna Be<br>
